## Introduction

 ![Homepage screenshot](images/read-me/homepage.png "Homepage screenshot")

 Hello! My name is Cassiopeia Neely, and I am a prospective front-end developer. [My portfolio](https://cassiopeian.github.io/) showcases six web apps I’ve developed, along with some of the art I created to illustrate these projects.

## Album Art

 <img src="images/read-me/albums-screenshot.png" style="width: 75%" />

 I loved to create album art for mixtapes, back in high school. So, I jumped at the opportunity to help, when my friend asked me to design something for her 2020 debut EP, *Five Petals of Venus*. I used Microsoft Word! Since then, I’ve regained access to Adobe CC programs, and I’ve been making art for my Spotify playlists.

 Scroll through the carousel with your trackpad or finger, or use the arrows to navigate.
